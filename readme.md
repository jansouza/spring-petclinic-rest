This backend version of the Spring Petclinic application only provides a REST API. **There is no UI**.
The [spring-petclinic-angular project](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular) is a Angular front-end application which consumes the REST API.

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams

### Petclinic ER Model

![alt petclinic-ermodel](petclinic-ermodel.png)

## Running Petclinic locally

### With Maven command line
```sh
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest.git
cd spring-petclinic-rest
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **Quarkus migration:** this project was migrated from Spring Boot to Quarkus (Spring compatibility strategy). See [docs/quarkus-migration-decisions.md](docs/quarkus-migration-decisions.md) and [docs/migration-report.md](docs/migration-report.md).

To build and run the packaged application:

`sh
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

### With Docker
```sh
docker run -p 9966:9966 springcommunity/spring-petclinic-rest
```

You can then access petclinic here: [http://localhost:9966/petclinic/](http://localhost:9966/petclinic/)

There is a health check route as well:
* [http://localhost:9966/petclinic/q/health](http://localhost:9966/petclinic/q/health)

By default the server only listens on 127.0.0.1. Set PETCLINIC_HTTP_HOST to change the bind address (e.g. inside a container).

## 📖 OpenAPI REST API Documentation

## Database configuration

By default, Petclinic uses an **in-memory H2 database**, which is automatically populated with sample data at startup.

### **Supported Databases**

Petclinic supports the following databases:

- **H2 (Default, In-Memory)**
- **HSQLDB (Alternative In-Memory Option)**
- **MySQL (Persistent)**
- **PostgreSQL (Persistent)**

### **Switching Databases**

The database is selected with a Quarkus profile (`-Dquarkus.profile=<profile>`), which loads `application-<profile>.properties`.

| Database  | Build / run |
|-----------|-------------|
| **H2** (Default) | `./mvnw quarkus:dev` |
| **HSQLDB** | _Not supported in Quarkus (no JDBC extension)_ |
| **MySQL** (Persistent) | `./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.profile=mysql` |
| **PostgreSQL** (Persistent) | `./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.profile=postgres` |

`quarkus.datasource.db-kind` is a build-time property, so MySQL and PostgreSQL require building the artifact with the matching profile. The Spring `jpa` / `jdbc` / `spring-data-jpa` repository-layer profiles no longer exist: the plain JPA implementation is always used.

### **Using H2 (Default)**
- No additional setup is required.
- The database schema and sample data are loaded automatically from `src/main/resources/db/h2/`.
- The H2 web console is not available in the Quarkus version.

### **Using HSQLDB**
- Not supported after the migration to Quarkus (there is no Quarkus JDBC extension for HSQLDB). Use H2, MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### **Using MySQL**
Build and run with the `mysql` profile:

```sh
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.profile=mysql
```
Start a MySQL database using Docker:
```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.4
```

### **Using PostgreSQL**
Build and run with the `postgres` profile:

```sh
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.profile=postgres
```
Start a PostgreSQL database using Docker:
```bash
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=petclinic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=petclinic -e POSTGRES_DB=petclinic -p 5432:5432 postgres:16.3
```

Instead of manually running containers, you can also use `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
docker-compose --profile mysql up
docker-compose --profile postgres up
```

## API First Approach

This API is built following some [API First approach principles](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/).

It is specified through the [OpenAPI](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/).
It is specified in this [file](./src/main/resources/openapi.yml).

Some of the required classes are generated during the build time. 
Here are the generated file types:
* DTOs
* API template interfaces specifying methods to override in the controllers

To see how to get them generated you can read the next chapter. 

## Generated code

Some of the required classes are generated during the build time using maven or any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ Idea or Eclipse).

All of these classes are generated into the ``target/generated-sources`` folder.

Here is a list of the generated packages and the corresponding tooling:

| Package name                                   | Tool             |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| org.springframework.samples.petclinic.mapper   | [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/)        |
| org.springframework.samples.petclinic.rest.dto | [OpenAPI Generator maven plugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/) |


To get both, you have to run the following command:

```jshelllanguage
mvn clean install
```

## Security configuration
In its default configuration, Petclinic doesn't have authentication and authorization enabled.

### Basic Authentication
In order to use the basic authentication functionality, turn in on from the `application.properties` file
```properties
petclinic.security.enable=true
```
This will secure all APIs and in order to access them, basic authentication is required.
Apart from authentication, APIs also require authorization. This is done via roles that a user can have.
The existing roles are listed below with the corresponding permissions 

* `OWNER_ADMIN` -> `OwnerController`, `PetController`, `PetTypeController` (`getAllPetTypes` and `getPetType`), `VisitController`
* `VET_ADMIN`   -> `PetTypeController`, `SpecialityController`, `VetController`
* `ADMIN`       -> `UserController`

There is an existing user with the username `admin` and password `admin` that has access to all APIs.
 In order to add a new user, please make `POST /api/users` request with the following payload:

```json
{
    "username": "secondAdmin",
    "password": "password",
    "enabled": true,
    "roles": [
    	{ "name" : "OWNER_ADMIN" }
    ]
}
```

## Performance Testing

To benchmark the scalability of the PetClinic REST API, a JMeter test plan is available.

- See the [JMeter Performance Test](src/test/jmeter/README.md) for details.
- Run the test using:
  ```sh
  jmeter -n -t src/test/jmeter/petclinic-jmeter-crud-benchmark.jmx \
  -Jthreads=100 -Jduration=600 -Jops=2000 -Jramp_time=120 \
  -l results/petclinic-test-results.jtl

## API Testing with Postman + Newman

This project contains **non-regression tests** for the Petclinic API, built with **Postman** and executed via **Newman**, with automated **HTML reports** for easy analysis.

- See the [Postman + Newman Test](src/test/postman/README.md) for details.
- You can run the tests with 2 ways:
  I. Giving Execution Permission to the script file:
    ```sh
    chmod +x postman-tests.sh
    ./postman-tests.sh
    ```
  II. Without Permission to the script file:
    ```sh
    zsh postman-tests.sh
    ```
> Note: You can use your currently bash installed. Like: "bash postman-tests.sh"

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest/) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
